-- HR Attrition Analysis â€“ SQL Project

-- Dataset Source:
-- IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
-- Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset
-- This dataset contains detailed employee-level data including attrition status, job satisfaction,
-- tenure, income, and other demographic and workplace factors.

-- Project Description:
-- This project uses SQL to analyze trends in employee attrition.
-- Insights include attrition rates by department, job satisfaction comparisons,
-- overtime impact, tenure insights, and demographic breakdowns.
-- The script is divided into logical sections and designed to support further dashboard visualization.

--  Section 1: Basic Data Exploration

-- 1.1 View sample data
SELECT * 
FROM employee_data
LIMIT 10;

-- 1.2 Total number of employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employee_data;

-- 1.3 Employees who left vs stayed
SELECT 
  Attrition,
  COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employee_data
GROUP BY Attrition;

-- 2.1 Attrition rate by Department
SELECT

FROM employee_data
GROUP BY Department;

-- 2.2 Attrition rate by JobRole
SELECT

  COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS attrition_rate_percent
FROM employee_data

--  Section 3: Satisfaction vs Attrition

-- 3.1 Average satisfaction scores by Attrition status

FROM employee_data
GROUP BY Attrition;

--  Section 4: Tenure, Age, and Income Analysis

-- 4.1 Years at company and MonthlyIncome by Attrition
SELECT 
  Attrition,
  ROUND(AVG(YearsAtCompany), 2) AS avg_years_at_company,

FROM employee_data
GROUP BY Attrition;

-- 4.2 Attrition by Age Bracket
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN Age < 30 THEN '<30'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
    ELSE '50+'
  END AS age_bracket,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_attrited,
  COUNT(*) AS total_in_group,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS attrition_rate_percent
FROM employee_data
GROUP BY age_bracket;

--  Section 5: Overtime, Gender, and Marital Status

-- 5.1 Attrition by OverTime
SELECT 
  OverTime,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_attrited,
  COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS attrition_rate_percent
FROM employee_data
GROUP BY OverTime;

-- 5.2 Attrition by Gender
SELECT 
  Gender,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_attrited,
  COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS attrition_rate_percent
FROM employee_data
GROUP BY Gender;
