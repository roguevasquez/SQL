# Rogue's SQL Portfolio: Bookstore, Fortune 500 & Climate Conference Analyses

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository showcases SQL queries I've written using three fictional but realistic datasets: a bookstore, a collection of Fortune 500 companies, and a climate research conference. Each project demonstrates my ability to extract insights through filtering, aggregation, joins, and categorization techniques.

## 📚 Bookstore Database Project

This dataset simulates a small bookstore with:
- 50 unique book entries  
- Data on **title, genre, price, stock quantity**, and **average rating**

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Filtering by price and genre  
- Aggregating data (e.g., average and max prices)  
- Answering practical business questions with SQL

**Sample SQL Queries Included:**
- 🧾 Ordered books by price  
- 📊 Calculated statistics like average and max book prices  
- 🔍 Queried genre-specific data (e.g., max price in *Fantasy*)  
- ❓ Answered stock-related questions like “How many Romance books are in stock?”

## 💼 Fortune 500 Companies Project

This dataset contains attributes for major U.S. companies across various industries:
- Fields include **revenue, employees, healthcare benefits, PTO**, and **average tenure**

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Logical filtering using `WHERE` with `AND`, `OR`, and `IN`  
- Revenue-per-employee calculations using aliases  
- Categorizing employee tenure using `CASE` statements  
- Industry-level revenue analysis with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  

**Sample SQL Queries Included:**
- 🏥 Found companies with healthcare and generous paid time off  
- 💰 Calculated revenue per employee across all companies  
- 🧠 Grouped companies by employee tenure category (e.g., High vs. Low Tenure)  
- 🏭 Compared industry averages to uncover high-performing sectors

## 🌎 Climate Conference Project

This dataset focuses on VIP attendees at a climate research conference, along with their event participation, hotel bookings, and RSVP statuses.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Joining data across multiple tables using `LEFT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, and `SELF JOIN`  
- Filtering on BIT fields (e.g., RSVP responses)  
- Using subqueries and multi-level logic to identify hotel booking trends

**Sample SQL Queries Included:**
- 📋 Matched VIPs to their events and hotels  
- 🔄 Tracked who each VIP is providing feedback to  
- ✅ Analyzed RSVP patterns for welcome and dinner events  
- 🏨 Identified the hotel with the highest number of reservations
