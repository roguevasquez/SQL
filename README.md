# Rogue's SQL Portfolio: Bookstore & Fortune 500 Analyses

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository showcases SQL queries I've written using two fictional but realistic datasets: a bookstore and a collection of Fortune 500 companies. Each project demonstrates my ability to extract insights through filtering, aggregation, and categorization techniques.

## 📚 Bookstore Database Project

This dataset simulates a small bookstore with:
- 50 unique book entries  
- Data on **title, genre, price, stock quantity**, and **average rating**

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Filtering by price and genre  
- Aggregating data (e.g., average and max prices)  
- Answering practical business questions with SQL

**Sample SQL Queries Included:**
- 🧾 Ordered books by price  
- 📊 Calculated statistics like average and max book prices  
- 🔍 Queried genre-specific data (e.g., max price in *Fantasy*)  
- ❓ Answered stock-related questions like “How many Romance books are in stock?”

## 💼 Fortune 500 Companies Project

This dataset contains attributes for major U.S. companies across various industries:
- Fields include **revenue, employees, healthcare benefits, PTO**, and **average tenure**

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Logical filtering using `WHERE` with `AND`, `OR`, and `IN`  
- Revenue-per-employee calculations using aliases  
- Categorizing employee tenure using `CASE` statements  
- Industry-level revenue analysis with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  

**Sample SQL Queries Included:**
- 🏥 Found companies with healthcare and generous paid time off  
- 💰 Calculated revenue per employee across all companies  
- 🧠 Grouped companies by employee tenure category (e.g., High vs. Low Tenure)  
- 🏭 Compared industry averages to uncover high-performing sectors
