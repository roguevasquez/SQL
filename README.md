# Rogue's SQL Portfolio: Bookstore Database

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL queries I've written using a fictional **bookstore database**. Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions.

## About the Project

This dataset simulates a small bookstore with:
- 50 unique book entries  
- Data on **title**, **genre**, **price**, **stock quantity**, and **average rating**  
- Useful for practicing filtering, aggregation, ordering, and querying categorical text

## Sample SQL Queries Included

- 📚 Ordered books by price  
- 📊 Calculated statistics like average and max book prices  
- 🎯 Queried genre-specific data (e.g., max price in *Fantasy*)  
- ❓ Answered practical questions like “How many Romance books are in stock?”

## Technologies Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL-style syntax)
- Markdown (for styling this README)
